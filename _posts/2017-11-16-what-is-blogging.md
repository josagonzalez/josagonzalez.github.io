I've been wanting to take a stab at blogging for some time now, but I could never think of what I would write about. Once I found out about [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) from a former co-worker and friend, I figured it was about time to give it a try. Then...procrastination hit, and I never got to writing my first post. Now I sit here with Kenz to my right watching some holiday bakeoff show and Kavu to my left chewing on a bone, perfect time to figure out this blogging thing. Going forward, I'd like to organize this blog and update it on a semi-regular basis. I will split up my posts the following way:

- Works - Anything from work or personal projects that may have a series of posts
- Topics - Any random posts that can deal with hobbies, thoughts, or reviews
- Travels - Well...travels

I'll give this strucutre a try and see how it works out. Bear with me as I learn this whole blogging thing. If you have any suggestions or tips, feel free to reach out!

Adios,  
Josafat
