This week is [Hour of Code](https://code.org) week at Heritage Elementary School. A few years ago I showed Mrs. Romero [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), a cool tool to get kids interested in coding. This year almost all of Heritage Elementary School is doing Hour of Code and I am answering some of the student's questions. Below are the questions and my answers to them! Feel free to check out my [about](https://josagonzalez.github.io/about/) for a little bit more about me. Happy coding! :computer:

- What made you want to code?  
  I have always been interested in technology and computers, so when I heard about computer science and coding, I wanted to learn more about it. After my first college class in computer science, I learned to code and I knew I wanted to do it as my career.
- Why did you start coding?  
  I started coding because I took a class for it in college. I was interested in computer science before but I didn't know how to start.
- How do you prevent hacks?  
  In my job, I prevent hacks by researching new security problems (like computer viruses) and keeping everyone at the company informed. I also make sure new code is secure before its published on our system.
- What did you know about computers in high school?  
  I knew a little bit about computers, but I definitely did not know how to code. I basically knew how to install programs, customize my computer, and things like that. I didn't learn to code until I was in college.
- What is your favorite part of computer science?  
  My favorite part about computer science is that you can create or build anything you can imagine. There are no barriers to building new things and having good ideas, as long as you have the will to learn, there is a way to build it.
- How do you stay safe on the internet?  
  It's very important to stay safe on the internet. A good way to do that is by making sure to only go to websites that you know are safe. Do not click on unknown links or go to websites you are not sure about, and do not put your password on websites that you are not sure about.
- How fun is your job?  
  My job is very fun! I enjoy working on challenging projects and making my company, our software, and the internet a safer place.
- What do you do to make the internet more safe?  
  As a security professional, I work to make my company and its software more secure, detect when someone is trying to hack our system, and keep users and customers data secure.
- What security do you use for your computer?  
  I make sure my computer is secure by making sure I have the newest software. This means staying informed on new security issues and finding a solution for them.
- Is your job hard to do?  
  My job can be hard at times, but it's also very rewarding. I like a good challenge and I enjoy seeing the positive results.
- How does coding help with cyber security?  
  Coding can help with cyber security if you, as a coder, emphasize security. Make sure to always consider security when writing code.
- Are there women who do your job?
  There are many fantastic women who do my job! Some of the best coders I've worked with are women!
- What did you learn about coding in high school and college?  
  I learned that coding is like solving a puzzle. There is always a solution to the puzzle, you just have to make sure that you can come to that solution as quickly and efficiently as possible.
- What high school did you go to?  
  I went to the academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology at Bartlett High School.
